        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
        <p>This pierogi recipe for Polish dumplings has been a family favorite from generation to generation. We traditionally make these for Christmas, but they can be made for any special event. There's some work involved, but the outcome is rewarding! The boiled pierogies can be fried in butter and onions or served with sour cream.</p>
        <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
        <h3>Potato Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 container sour cream</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round. Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
